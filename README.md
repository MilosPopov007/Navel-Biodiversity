# Navel-Biodiversity

Biodiversity Data Analytics using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web

## Project Overview

Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. " Biodiversity " microbiology laboratory role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, " Biodiversity " is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.

" Biodiversity " has partnered with " Improbable Beef ", a food startup, to research candidates species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However " Improbable beef " is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.
" Biodiversity " laboratory has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and believes it could be found quite close to home from bacteria found on the human body. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person's eyelashes, for example. Furthermore, between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. " Biodiversity " hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone's belly button.

To test hypothesis, " Biodiversity " laboratory has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identity is anonymous. They've instead been assigned an ID number. For this project I used " Biodiversity " microbiology laboratory data to create a dashboard with JS and Plotly.js that will allow researchers and those who participated in the study to select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels. Who knows what they might find ?

For purposes of this Analysis, several steps were taken :

* Use of D3.json() to fetch external data
* Use of functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data
* Use of event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization
* Create plots with Plotly, including bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart
* Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages
